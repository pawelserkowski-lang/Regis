# Regis & Cyberdeck Protocol

**Regis** is a local intelligence agent designed to manage project status, security analysis, and development workflows.
**Cyberdeck Protocol** is the futuristic interface that allows humans to interact with the underlying data and protocols managed by Regis.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository houses the **Cyberdeck Ecosystem**, a dual-layer system comprising:

1.  **Regis (The Agent)**: A Python-based local agent that monitors the codebase, generates detailed status reports in JSON format, and maintains the project's "pulse" (security, progress, risks).
2.  **Cyberdeck (The Interface)**: A high-fidelity Electron + React application offering a visual environment to view protocols, edit code, and interact with the system.

## 🛠️ Components

### 1. Regis (Core)
Located in the root directory.
- **`regis.py`**: The brain. Generates `status_report.json`.
- **`regis_cli.py`**: The voice. A CLI wrapper with advanced logging and distinct persona outputs.
- **`status_report.json`**: The output. A live JSON file tracking the project's state, used by other tools or the Cyberdeck itself.

### 2. Cyberdeck Protocol (UI)
Located in `cyber-deck-protocol/`.
- Built with **Electron**, **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**.
- Features **Monaco Editor** for code interaction.
- Provides a futuristic "cyberpunk" aesthetic for system management.

## 📦 Quick Start

### Running the Agent (Regis)
To update the system status:
```bash
python regis.py
# or for the CLI experience
python regis_cli.py
```

### Launching the Deck (UI)
1. Navigate to the protocol directory:
   ```bash
   cd cyber-deck-protocol
   ```
2. Install modules:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Initialize the link:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
